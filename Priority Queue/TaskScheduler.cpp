/**
 * You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. 
 * Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. 
 * Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: 
 *      identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
 * 
 * â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
 * After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. 
 * The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. 
 * By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
 * With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.
 * There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. 
 * This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

/**
 * The time complexity of the optimized approach for the task scheduling problem is O(N), 
 * where N is the number of tasks.
 * 
 * Here's why:
 * Counting the number of occurrences of each task takes O(N) time, where N is the number of tasks.
 * Sorting the task count array takes O(26 log 26) time, which is essentially O(1) because the size of the array is fixed (26 letters in the English alphabet).
 * The for loop that fills the idle slots runs 26 times in the worst case (when all tasks are different), 
 * so it takes O(1) time.
 * 
 * Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N) + O(1) + O(1) = O(N).
 * However, if the input tasks are not limited to 26 types and can be considered as M types, 
 * the time complexity of sorting would be O(M log M), and the time complexity of the for loop would be O(M). So, the overall time complexity would be O(N + M log M).
